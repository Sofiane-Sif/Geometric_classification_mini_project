# Geometric classificication project
--- 

#### 1 - Generate a synthetic dataset of shapes, such as rectangles, triangles, and ellipses, with random position, orientation, and color. The dataset should be sufficiently large and varied to allow for robust training and testing of the model.

#### 2 - Train a classification model on the dataset and evaluate its performance on a held-out test set.

1. Step 1 - Install all packages
to install all packages :
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Step 2 - Generate the dataset (run generate_dataset.py will create dataset folder with 3000 images for each shape (rectangles, ellipses and triangles).

3. Step 3 - Make predictions on new shape images (run predict.py)
