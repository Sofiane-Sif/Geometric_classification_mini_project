# Geometric classificication project

## The purpose of this project is to generate a dataset of synthetic shapes and to train a model to classify them. 
## The project consists of the following tasks:

### 1 - Generate a synthetic dataset of shapes, such as rectangles, triangles, and ellipses, with random position, orientation, and color. The dataset should be sufficiently large and varied to allow for robust training and testing of the model.

### 2 - Train a classification model on the dataset and evaluate its performance on a held-out test set.
